# n8n Workflows Repository

This repository contains a collection of [n8n](https://n8n.io/) workflows exported as JSON files. These workflows automate various tasks, integrating with tools and services to streamline processes.

## Purpose
The goal is to share reusable n8n workflows for common automation tasks, making it easy for others to import, customize, and deploy them in their own n8n instances.

## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - An active n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted).
   - Basic knowledge of n8n's interface and nodes.

2. **Using a Workflow**:
   - Download a `.json` file from this repository.
   - In n8n, go to the workflows section and select **Import from File**.
   - Upload the JSON file.
   - Configure credentials and nodes as needed (e.g., API keys, URLs).
   - Save and activate the workflow.

3. **Folder Structure**:
   ```
   /workflows
   ├── workflow1.json
   ├── workflow2.json
   └── ...
   ```
   Each JSON file represents a single n8n workflow.

## Contributing
- Feel free to submit pull requests with new workflows or improvements.
- Ensure workflows are well-documented within n8n (use node descriptions).
- Test workflows before submitting to confirm they work as expected.

## Notes
- Some workflows may require specific n8n nodes or credentials. Check the workflow's nodes for dependencies.
- For complex setups, consider adding a brief description in the JSON file's name or within the workflow.
